# Java Calculator with JUnit Testing

## Project Overview

This project is a simple Java-based Calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It's designed to demonstrate the use of JUnit for writing and executing test cases. The Calculator class provides static methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Java Features

- **Static Methods**: Utilizes static methods for basic arithmetic operations.
- **Exception Handling**: Implements basic error handling, especially for division by zero scenarios.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Follows best practices in code organization for maintainability and readability.

## JUnit Testing

The project includes a comprehensive suite of JUnit tests to validate the functionality of the Calculator class.

### Key Testing Features

- **assertEquals Method**: Employs `assertEquals` from JUnit to ensure the expected output matches the actual results from Calculator methods.
- **assertTrue Method**: Uses `assertTrue` to validate conditions in certain test cases.
- **Test Coverage**: Each arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide) is covered with multiple test cases to ensure robustness.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, simply clone the repository and execute the `CalculatorTest` class in an environment with JUnit setup.
